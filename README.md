# ML project

The dataset is composed of 1000 samples with 20 features each. The first column
is the sample id. The second column in the dataset represents the label. There
are 2 possible values for the labels. The remaining columns are numeric
features.

The task is the following: assuming that we want to classify this data with a
Random Forest (implemented by sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier), we
should determine whether applying PCA to this dataset is useful, and if so what
number of components we would choose to use. At the end of the analysis, we
should have chosen an optimal strategy, including the optimal set of parameters
for the classifier.
